# HANDBOOK — IncidentVoice (Megathon X × Qualcomm)

Running log of what happened, what was decided, and where things stand. `PRD.md` is the spec; this file is the history and the current status. Newest entries at the top of §2.

## 1. Current state (2026-10-10)

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Spec | `PRD.md` v1.0 written (≈ 3.4k lines). Single source of truth. |
| Board | SM8750P (Snapdragon 8 Elite, HTP V79), Android 15 userdebug, 15.5 GB RAM. `/data/local/tmp` wiped → 29 GB free. Clock still wrong (2024, GMT) — fix at H0 (PRD §26.3). |
| Laptop | Caches + old WSL artifacts cleaned (C: 7.6 → ~14 GB free). **Pending:** VHDX compaction — sparse flag removed after diskpart error; user re-runs diskpart as admin → ~120 GB free. |
| Models | None exported yet (hackathon rule: nothing built before the clock). Base Llama 3.2 3B weights + qai-hub-models 0.63.0 + AI Hub token already in WSL. |
| Code | None yet. Repo has docs + `qidk/` reference + `_board_runtime_backup/` (QAIRT 2.47 V79 runtime pulled from the board). |
| Architecture | Plan A (in-app JNI) vs Plan B (shell-user server) undecided until the probe APK runs (PRD §26.6, ~H3). |

## 2. Log

### 2026-10-10 (later) — Branch workflow + VHDX compaction error

**Branch workflow (from user + updated CLAUDE.md):** all ML work commits go to `Saarthak`; separate branches will own Android and Web/Dashboard. Main carries `HANDBOOK.md`, `CHANGE.md` (cross-branch change announcements), `STATUS.md` (what exists now); each branch keeps `handover_<branch>.md`. Created `CHANGE.md`, `STATUS.md`, `handover_Saarthak.md`. PRD v1.0 was pushed to `main` and `Saarthak` as `8ff065e`.

**Open question logged in CHANGE.md:** PRD D-44 puts the dashboard inside the Android app, but the team now has a Web/Dashboard branch → team must decide and PRD §23 gets updated.

**Error:** user ran the VHDX compaction (PRD Appendix H); diskpart failed:
`DiskPart has encountered an error: The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation. Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse.`
**Cause:** during cleanup I had enabled sparse VHD (`wsl --manage Ubuntu --set-sparse true`); diskpart cannot compact sparse VHDX files. The sparse flag alone did not return space to Windows (C: stayed ~14 GB free).
**Fix:** `wsl --shutdown; wsl --manage Ubuntu --set-sparse false` (succeeded), then re-run `diskpart /s $env:TEMP\compact.txt` as admin. **Lesson:** use one method — either sparse + fstrim, or non-sparse + diskpart compact; never mix.

### 2026-10-10 — Discovery, clarification, PRD

**Inputs read:** `Problem Statement.pptx` (5 slides + notes: STT → LLM extraction → mandatory-field check → function calling → review/submit, TTS + screen; criteria: on-device Snapdragon, natural speech, ASR accuracy, extraction accuracy, field mapping), `RA.txt`, `problems_setup.md`, `qidk/GenAI-Solutions/ASR-LLM-TTS` and `Solutions/NLPSolution3-…-Whisper` READMEs, `qidk guide.pdf` (HDK8650 hardware quick-start: mics, 3.5 mm jack, speakers, HDMI DIP switches), the previous project's `EXPORT_RESEARCH.md`.

**Board findings (adb, verified):**
- `ro.soc.model=SM8750P` → **V79**, not the V75 board from `problems_setup.md`. The previous project's fine-tuned bundle (`Desktop\qidk\qidk_backup\genie_bundle_ft`, soc_model 57/v75) **cannot** run here.
- `/dev/fastrpc-cdsp` exists (old board had none) → in-app NPU likely works; Qualcomm's own ASR-LLM-TTS sample runs Genie in-app on SM8750.
- Leftover runtime on board was QAIRT **2.47** → too old for AI Hub's 2.50 compiles → download QAIRT 2.50 at H0.
- Only TTS engine: eSpeak NG (`com.reecedunn.espeak`).
- Clock 2024-08-14, timezone GMT.
- `/data` was 97 % full (other project's 27 GB in `/data/local/tmp`).

**Measured/published speeds (qai-hub-models 0.63 `perf.yaml`, Galaxy S25 = same SoC):** Llama 3.2 3B w4a16 Genie ≈ 28 tok/s decode, ≈ 730 tok/s prefill; Whisper-small encoder ≈ 66 ms, decoder ≈ 8.4 ms/token.

**Actions taken (user-approved):**
- Pulled board runtime (QAIRT 2.47 V79 libs, genie-t2t-run, qnn-net-run, validator) → `_board_runtime_backup/`.
- Deleted everything in board `/data/local/tmp` (kept installed apps).
- Laptop: deleted WSL `~/gptq_out`, `~/qaihm_work/ftgptq16_ckpt`, `~/smartcity_runs`, go-build cache, pip/npm/uv/pnpm/puppeteer caches, Windows `%TEMP%`; enabled sparse VHD + fstrim. Kept HF Llama weights, venvs, AI Hub token, `Desktop\qidk`, Docker.
- CLI NPU probe via `run-as` + `qnn-platform-validator`: **inconclusive** (exec'd binaries lack the app linker namespace for `libcdsprpc.so`). Real probe must be an APK.

**Clarification:** 60 questions asked across 15 rounds; answers recorded as decisions D-01…D-64 in PRD §4. Key ones: 15-hour hackathon, 3 people, nothing before the clock; stock Llama 3.2 3B + Whisper-small on NPU, fine-tunes as gated stretch; EHS domain with 10 categories; validator rule-based; templated voice follow-ups (≤2 fields, ≤3 rounds); SOP-grounded recommendations from the same Llama; Kotlin/Compose/Room+FTS5; Plan A/B decided by probe; Llama export on Kaggle at H0.

**Output:** `PRD.md` v1.0, `.gitignore`, this handbook.

## 3. Open items before / at H0

1. User runs the VHDX compaction (PRD Appendix H).
2. Qualcomm ID ready for QAIRT 2.50 download; Kaggle account with phone verification (Internet ON) + secrets `HF_TOKEN`, `QAIHUB_TOKEN`.
3. Llama 3.2 licence accepted on Hugging Face for the account whose token Kaggle uses.
4. Wired headset mic + fan + HDMI cable for the demo (PRD §6.4).
5. Branch names (team to decide, PRD §34.2).
