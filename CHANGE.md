# CHANGE.md — cross-branch change log

Purpose: announce any change on one branch that affects another branch (contracts, schemas, file paths, APIs, model files, board setup). Read this before starting work; append before pushing a change that others depend on.

**Branches**
| Branch | Area | Handover file |
|---|---|---|
| `Saarthak` | ML / NPU: models, export, native inference, prompts, taxonomy, eval | `handover_Saarthak.md` |
| (Android branch, name TBD) | Android app, including the dashboard | `handover_<branch>.md` |

Only two branches: **App** and **ML**. No separate web/dashboard branch.

**Entry format**

## 2026-10-10 — Saarthak — Project docs baseline
- What changed: `PRD.md` v1.0 is the single source of truth. Shared contracts live in PRD Appendix A (`config/taxonomy.json`), B (`config/sop.json`), C (prompts), D (tool-call schemas + engine DTOs), E (SQL DDL).
- Who is affected: all branches.
- Action needed by others: any change to a field key, enum value, schema or DTO must be announced here **and** made in PRD.md in the same commit.
- Commit: 8ff065e

## 2026-10-10 — Saarthak — Decision: dashboard is app-only
- What changed: dashboard stays **inside the Android app** (PRD D-44 and §23 unchanged). No web dashboard, no Web branch. Branches are App + ML only.
- Who is affected: Android branch (owns the dashboard: recency list, FTS search, filters, stats, detail view).
- Action needed: none for ML; Android builds PRD §23 as specified.

## 2026-10-10 21:20 — Saarthak — PRD rev 1.1 (affects App)
- What changed (full list PRD §4.0 R1-01…R1-14):
  - **Search:** Room `@Fts4` instead of FTS5/bundled SQLite (PRD §21.4 note).
  - **Time:** if not spoken, `occurred_at` = report time, approximate, status `DEFAULTED` (amber in review), not asked.
  - **Recommendations:** P0 shows SOP templates (`config/sop.json`) only; no LLM call for recommendations in P0.
  - **ASR:** P0 engine is whisper.cpp (CPU) behind `InferenceEngine.transcribe()` — same `AsrResult` contract.
  - **P0 cut:** narration cap 30 s; no draft resume UI, multi-incident flow, status lifecycle beyond SUBMITTED, dashboard charts, PDF/JSON export. **Kept:** Silero VAD, Hinglish follow-up templates.
- Who is affected: App branch.
- Action needed: App follows PRD v1.1 §4.0; nothing else in the contracts (taxonomy, tool schemas, DTOs) changed.
- Commit: (this commit)
